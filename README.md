# Library
This project is a Library Management System backend built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It supports creating, fetching (single/all), searching by name, sorting by author or created date, updating, and deleting books. Modular routes, controllers, and error handling make it easy to test via Postman or connect to a frontend.
